She's back again in this night
In silence She's hexing everyone around
I'm one victim this woman, yeah
No. Nothing compares  to an Italian

Your way like a summer
Your eyes like fire
The most beautiful rose
In the Garden of Babylon

What's your name
Whats's your game
I'm more one fool
In this game of love


She doesn't give in to anyone
And her doesn't play seduction's infant games
The curse of Lady Godiva
Dropped me like glove in the shadown zone


Your way like a summer
Your eyes like fire
The most beautiful rose
In the Garden of Babylon

What's your name
Whats's your game
I'm more one fool
In this game of love


Like a love never dies


In this cursed city I saw
A beautiful rose in Garden of Babylon
Yeah 
Yeah
Ahho Like a love never dies
